I signed up to the for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and more gruenling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I´ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>

                <p class="opacity-7">"Before joining the bootcamp, I´ve never written a line of code. I needed somo structuro from professionals who can help me programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student from theirs who can only say wonderful things about the programe. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i´ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
